## Stack

- Spring MVC
- MyBatis mapper/XML for persistence SQL
- Testcontainers for PostGIS/pg_vector integration verification
- Lombok (Required: Use `@RequiredArgsConstructor`, `@AllArgsConstructor`, or `@NoArgsConstructor` to eliminate constructor boilerplate)
- PostgreSQL/PostGIS
- Multi Module

## architecture

The project is organized around the monolithic `core-api` target shape plus lower-level storage and batch/runtime support:

- `core:core-api`: primary Spring Boot executable module.
  - API entrypoint: `com.ssafy.enjoytrip.EnjoyTripApplication`.
  - Worker entrypoint: `com.ssafy.enjoytrip.core.api.worker.EnjoyTripWorkerApplication`.
  - HTTP/API code lives under `com.ssafy.enjoytrip.core.api.web.*`.
  - Kafka/Scheduled/background worker ingress lives under `com.ssafy.enjoytrip.core.api.worker.*`.
  - Domain models, application services, and support contracts live here; database access uses storage Record/MyBatis types directly.
  - API-facing concrete outbound integration clients and neutral result DTOs live in `external`; `core-api` depends on `external` directly and maps external results to domain models at the service call path. Batch-only embedding clients are compiled in `batch`; the `external` module must not depend on `core-api` or `core`.
  - `:core:core-api:check` is the primary executable-module verification command.
- `core:core-enum`: enum-only shared module for values used by both `core-api` and `db-core`.
- `storage:db-core`: storage Record contracts, MyBatis mapper interfaces/XML/type handlers, Flyway migrations, and database configuration.
  - Do not place web/controller, worker ingress, domain service, or external API client code here.
- `external`: independent module with no `core-api` or `core` dependency. API-facing third-party concrete clients, configuration, and neutral result DTOs live here; batch-only embedding clients live in `batch`.
- `batch`: separate batch runtime. Batch job ingress, parameter parsing, batch-only services, and batch-only outbound clients stay in `batch`.

The legacy `app`, `app/web`, and `app/worker` modules are removed in the target shape. Do not add
them back.

Default request flow:

```text
core-api web controller -> core-api service -> storage Record/MyBatis
```

Default worker flow:

```text
core-api worker ingress -> core-api service/processor -> storage Record/MyBatis
```

Layering rules:

- Controllers should be thin. They translate HTTP requests into service calls and return HTTP responses.
- Controllers must use named request/response DTO objects. Do not use `Map`, `Map.of(...)`, `@RequestParam Map`, `@RequestBody Map`, or `ApiResponse<Map<...>>` for controller request/response contracts.
- Worker ingress should only translate runtime messages/events into service or processor calls.
- Web packages must not own Kafka listener, scheduled worker, or background-only retry/error handler code.
- Worker packages must not own controllers, OpenAPI contracts, REST Docs, web DTOs, or REST response envelopes.
- Controllers and workers must not call persistence/MyBatis mappers directly.
- Services may import storage Record/MyBatis types; web controllers and worker ingress must not call storage/MyBatis mappers directly.
- Core-api services use `external` concrete client/result DTO types directly for API-facing outbound integrations. Do not add core-owned outbound interface/port/gateway contracts for `external` to implement.
- When services convert storage Records into core domain models, instantiate the domain model directly with `new` at the
  service call path for one-off conversions. If the same long storage Record -> domain model conversion repeats inside
  one service, a private service-local helper is allowed for duplicate removal. Do not create mapper layers or put
  core-api domain model conversion methods on `storage:db-core` entities.
- Web request DTOs must not be passed into `core.domain.service` methods, and web-only command wrapper records should
  not live under `core.domain`. Controllers should pass domain models, existing core query/value objects, or explicitly
  unpacked normalized primitive/value parameters to services.
- `core:core-enum` must stay enum-only.

## Project Rule Hierarchy

Project server/runtime work must use the three-layer rule structure below.

1. `CONSTITUTION.md` — mandatory constitution
   - Read this first before changing project server/runtime code.
   - It is the highest-priority project rule document.
   - If any module `AGENTS.md`, local convention, plan, or precedent conflicts with it, follow `CONSTITUTION.md`.
2. `RULES.md` — operational templates and concrete field rules
   - Use this for module-specific checklists, security templates, migration templates, and completion reporting.
   - It may only make the constitution more concrete; it must not weaken it.
3. `PRECEDENTS.md` — accumulated cases
   - Record repeated decisions, exceptions, and field cases here first.
   - When the same decision pattern appears 3 times, promote it to `RULES.md` and mark the precedents as promoted.

Session-start enforcement:

- A Codex `SessionStart` hook is configured to load `CONSTITUTION.md` into session context for this repository.
- A Codex `Stop` hook is configured to check changed project module files against `CONSTITUTION.md` and `RULES.md` before a turn finishes.
- Even if the hook is unavailable, agents must manually read and follow `CONSTITUTION.md` before project server/runtime edits.

Completion reports for project server/runtime changes must state which layer was used: `CONSTITUTION.md`, `RULES.md`, and/or `PRECEDENTS.md`.
