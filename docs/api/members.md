## Profile image updates

`PUT /api/members/me` is no longer the profile-image mutation path. Use
[`Member Profile Images API`](member-profile-images.md) to create a presigned upload URL and persist the uploaded
`objectKey`. Member read responses continue to expose only `profileImageUrl` for display compatibility.
