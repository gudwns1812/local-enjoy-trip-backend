# Storage Module Coding Style & Rules

## Operating Principles

- **Persistence Layer**: The `storage` namespace keeps `storage/db-core`, which handles database schema mapping and persistence infrastructure.
- **DB Core Only**: `storage/db-core` owns storage Record contracts, MyBatis mapper interfaces, XML SQL, type handlers, Flyway migrations, and database configuration only.
- **Technology Stack**: Uses MyBatis mapper/XML for persistence SQL. PostGIS, pg_vector, dynamic predicates, joins, projections, native mutations, `on conflict`, and `returning` are expressed as explicit mapper SQL. **JdbcTemplate, Spring Data JPA repositories, and jOOQ runtime/codegen are not used for new persistence paths.**
- **DB Core Local Rules**: `storage/db-core/AGENTS.md` owns db-core specific Record/MyBatis/test rules. Read it before changing db-core code, XML, migration, or tests.

## Coding Style

- **Storage Record Contracts**: Storage Record classes are plain Java contracts used by MyBatis. Do not add JPA annotations or Spring Data auditing callbacks. Timestamp fields are populated by DB defaults or explicit mapper SQL.
- **MyBatis Mappers**: Mapper interfaces/XML stay in `storage/db-core` and return storage contracts directly; do not wrap them in core-domain repository ports or custom storage repository/model layers.
- **Lombok**: Ensure storage Record classes use `@NoArgsConstructor(access = AccessLevel.PROTECTED)`.
- **Data Transformation**: Do not add separate mapping layers for core-domain ports. Storage Records must not expose
  `toModel`/`toDomain` methods that return core-api domain models. In the monolithic target, core-api services that need
  a domain object should instantiate it directly from the storage Record at the service call path.
- **MyBatis SQL**: Keep SQL in mapper XML and use parameter binding; do not build SQL through ad-hoc string concatenation in services.

## Verification

- **Transaction Boundaries**: Core-api service/helper write/delete methods should declare `@Transactional` when needed.
- **Native Mutations**: Native update/delete/upsert operations must be implemented in MyBatis mapper XML. JPA `@Query(nativeQuery = true)` and jOOQ DSL are prohibited.
- **Mapper Tests**: General mapper tests use H2 in-memory DB. Testcontainers is reserved for PostGIS/pg_vector paths that H2 cannot validate.
